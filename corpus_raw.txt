Deep Learning has evolved from Artificial Neural Networks, which has been
there since the 1940s. Neural Networks are interconnected networks of processing units
called artificial neurons that loosely mimic axons in a biological brain. In a biological
neuron, the dendrites receive input signals from various neighboring neurons, typically
greater than 1000. These modified signals are then passed on to the cell body or soma of
the neuron, where these signals are summed together and then passed on to the axon of the
neuron. If the received input signal is more than a specified threshold, the axon will
release a signal which again will pass on to neighboring dendrites of other neurons. Figure
2-1 depicts the structure of a biological neuron for reference. The artificial neuron units
are inspired by the biological neurons with some modifications as per convenience. Much
like the dendrites, the input connections to the neuron carry the attenuated or amplified
input signals from other neighboring neurons. The signals are passed on to the neuron, where
the input signals are summed up and then a decision is taken what to output based on the
total input received. For instance, for a binary threshold neuron an output value of 1 is
provided when the total input exceeds a pre-defined threshold; otherwise, the output stays
at 0. Several other types of neurons are used in artificial neural networks, and their
implementation only differs with respect to the activation function on the total input to
produce the neuron output. In Figure 2-2 the different biological equivalents are tagged in
the artificial neuron for easy analogy and interpretation.
